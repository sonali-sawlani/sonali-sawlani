### Sonali Sawlani
<br>
Hey, this is Sonali (Computer Science graduate) having 3 years of experience in software development.
<br>
Currently I am working as Java Backend Developer in an august organization.
<br>
My passion for coding dates back to high school days when I got excited just by moving some text on my static webpage (if anyone remembers the marquee tag). 
<br>
A few of my hobbies apart from tech industry includes sketching, traveling to get wind of new places and cultures. Last couple of years have taught me that your mindset matters the most for your growth. The idea that motivates me is to be competent enough to avoid stagnation.
